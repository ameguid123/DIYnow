# DIYnow

Please see documentation.txt for a guide to the repository layout, for setting up the website, and for usage information!

DIYnow is a website that pulls pictures and titles of tech/diy projects from other websites (such as makezine, instructables, and hackedgadgets) so that you can browse through projects, click an image, and be redirected to whichever post on a website it came from. The site also allows you to favorite projects, storing them in "My Projects" for later browsing. Finally, no matter where on the site you are, you can search for new projects by a keyword or category. Simply type into the searchbar at the top left of the navbar, and hit enter or click the search button. The site will then load and
redirect you to the Home page with the results for your search.
