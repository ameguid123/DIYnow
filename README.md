# DIYnow

Please see documentation.txt for a guide to the repository layout, for setting up the website, and for usage information!

DIYnow is a website that pulls random pictures and titles of tech/diy projects from other websites (such as makezine, instructables, and hackedgadgets) so that you can browse through projects, click an image, and be redirected to whichever post on a website it came from. The site also allows you to favorite projects, storing them in "My Projects" for later browsing. Finally, you can also filter for new projects by a keyword or category.
